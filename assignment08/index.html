<h3>DESIGN STATEMENT</h3>
<br>
<p>
The project that I designed this quarter is a mobile application called Tradepost. Tradepost is an app where users can buy and sell furniture with other users. This project was inspired by my own experiences moving into an apartment for the first time. I really wanted to save money, so I ended up buying some of my furniture online using websites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. This year, I moved again, and I ended up using these websites to sell some of my furniture. <br><br>

Although I was still able to accomplish my goals with these websites, I found myself experiencing a lot of frustration, especially with encountering dishonest sellers and even scammers at times. It was also difficult to find the specific items that I wanted, because they’re not catered for furniture. Inspired by my own experiences, I designed Tradepost to be a marketplace that’s specifically catered to buying and selling furniture.

<h3>Competitor Analysis & Usability Evaluation</h3>
<br>      

<br>
          <img src="https://lisalbi.github.io/DH-150/depop1.PNG" style="float: left; width: 20%; margin-right: 10%; margin-left: 25%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
<img src="https://lisalbi.github.io/DH-150/offerup1.PNG" style="float: left; width: 20%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
      <p style="clear: both;">
          <br>
<p>For the competitor analysis, I analyzed OfferUp and Depop. Offerup is a resale market with an emphasis on in-person transactions. Depop is a popular clothing resale market that implements features of social media applications. I decided to evaluate OfferUp because it is one of the largest resale markets and Depop because of it’s large cultural reach and it’s success in tapping into new trends among consumers. These two applications are opposite in terms of their execution. OfferUp is very utilitarian and plain, while Depop is bold and trendy. I wanted to study what aspects these applications got right, and what aspects they got wrong. <br>
          
In order to examine the usability of these applications, I conducted a heuristic evaluation in order to identify usability problems. I found that OfferUp has issues with its layout of images as well as the placement of ads. Depop has issues with its efficiency of use. The full findings can be found below:</p>

</div>
          
<br>
    <p>
In addition, I also conducted a usability test with OfferUp. Based on the findings from my heuristic evaluation, I hoped to evaluate the usability of the app by conducting pilot usability testing. I also hoped to test the overall effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction that the app does or does not provide. I wanted to uncover any issues that I may have missed in my heuristic evaluation. The usability test confirmed and also revealed several issues. It confirmed some of the things that I had suspected would cause issues, such as the disruptive ads and the difficulty in unlisting items. It also revealed several other issues, such as the lack of system status while searching as far as shipping vs. pickup method, and the fact that notifications persist in the inbox even after they’re resolved, which can create confusion. The video of the usability test can be found below:

<h3>User Research</h3>
      <p>
<br>
In order to better understand the motivation, needs, and behaviors of users, I conducted two user research studies involving interviewing and participatory observation. During the interview, my goal was to gain an understanding of user habits, how users utilize online market places to meet their goals, and what pain points they commonly face. During the participatory observation, I observed a user performing two activities: searching and selecting an item, and listing an item. The purpose of this activity was to understand their process and the logic behind their decision making.<br><br>
The interview confirmed to me that facilitating trustworthiness between buyers and sellers is important. This is especially relevant because most resale markets do not allow refunds, so buyers must have confidence in sellers. An aspect that I hadn’t thought of before is that feedback and interaction can encourage sellers to stay on the platform. Platforms that do not have likes or other methods of interaction may be less beneficial, since sellers may be more likely to become discouraged. 
<br><br>
Based on these findings, I identified several features that would address certain needs and pain points of users
<ul>
    <li><strong>Filters</strong> - Allow users to filter by type, color, condition, price, and location.
</li>
  <li><strong>Simple listing process</strong> - A simple listing process with pre-set categories and the ability to copy prior listings would make listing easier and more convenient.</li>
  <li><strong>User profiles and reviews</strong> - This creates greater trustworthiness and less anonymity.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>UX storytelling</h3>
<p>
<br>
The purpose of UX Storytelling is to help designers understand and empathize with the users of their products. UX Storytelling involves taking user data and repackaging it in a way that makes it clear and memorable, allowing UX designers to more effectively communicate insights from research and see things from users' perspective. It can be difficult to understand insights from raw data or bullet points — UX Storytelling instead communicates this information in a way that is memorable, easier to understand, and more likely to resonate, because storytelling is a powerful tool for communication. In this activity, I used UX storytelling as a way to understand how users use online resale markets.<br>
<br>
Based on the results of the prior research, I created two personas and empathy maps with the goal of understanding users' goals, needs, motivations, and pain points. <br>

<h3>Low-fidelity Prototype, Wireframes and Graphic Design Element Variation</h3>
<p> The low fidelity prototype was created in Adobe XD. The purpose was to begin the implementation of important features identified through my user research. Features implemented in this prototype include searching and filtering, viewing user profiles and reviews, making offers, and favoriting items. The wireflow can be seen below:
</p>
<br>

<img src="https://lisalbi.github.io/DH-150/wireflow4.png" width="50%" class="center"> <br>

<p>
In order to assess the usability of the design, I conducted a virtual usability test with the low-fidelity prototype. The participant was asked to complete a series of tasks: <br>
<p> <ul>
  <li>Search for an item and filter the search results.</li>
  <li>View your offers and show how to accept or deny them.</li>
  <li>View the items that you favorited.</li>
  <li>View reviews of a seller.</li>
</ul></p>
   

<p>The video of the virtual usability test can be viewed below:</p>

<h3>High-fidelity Interactive Prototype</h3>
<br>
<img src="https://lisalbi.github.io/DH-150/allwireframes.png" width=40% class="center"> <br>
<p>
The high-fidelity prototype was created using Adobe XD. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to implement the visual aspects of the design and study their effect on the user's experience. I paid special attention to aspects such as color, typography, readability, and visual hierarchy. When designing the visual aesthetic of the app, my goal was to create a clean, organized, and cohesive interface design. To reach this goal, I made sure to implement a minimalistic style across the app, without umnecessary embellishments. I used a fairly limited color palette. The primary fonts are Montserrat and Helvetica Neue, with varying font weights. In order to ensure readability, I conducted contrast testing on the interface.  <br><br>
The interactive prototype can be used below:

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>

<br>
Following this, I conducted an impression test to assess users' immediate reaction to the design. This study was conducted virtually. The participant was given a link to view the wireframes, and asked about their initial reaction and thoughts. They were also asked to choose words to describe the app. <br>
<br>

<br>
In addition, I conducted a cognitive walkthrough to assess the usability of the app with a different participant. The participant was asked to walkthrough a series of tasks, including: <br>
        <ul>
  <li>Search for an item and filter the search results.</li>
  <li>View and accept offers.</li>
            <li>Make a listing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the results of the impression test and cognitive walkthrough, the high fidelity prototype was successful in conveying the purpose and features offered by the application. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<br>
    <p>
        Overall, the process of creating Tradepost was enjoyable and a valuable learning experience in understanding the process of user experience design. I was able to gain first-hand experience in the product design cycle. The most important lesson was understanding the importance of empathizing and seeing things from the perspective of users, rather than only relying on my own judgements. This was sometimes difficult because as a designer, I am used to following my own instincts. By getting feedback from users, whether it be from user research, usability testing, impression testing, and more, I was able to discover weaknesses in the product and gain insight on how to improve the overall experience of users. In the future, I would like to conduct more usability tests in order to evaluate how the app, especially the offering system, can be further improved.
