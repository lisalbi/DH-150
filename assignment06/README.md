## Project Description
The current project seeks to provide a user-to-user resale app for furniture. Resale markets currently available tend to focus on clothes or allow all products. The goal of the current project is to create a specialized market for furniture. With this in mind, the app will be designed with the goals, motivations, needs, and pain points of furniture buyers in mind. 

* **User Research:** The target audience are those who buy furniture second hand. This audience tends to be young to middle aged, low to middle class income, live in urban or suburban areas, and have a variety of education levels. Based on user interviews and market research, I found that users prioritized ease of use and convenience, favoring apps that have quick and simple listing processes. Moreover, feedback and interaction with other users creates a more satisfying user experience, especially for sellers. This is because sellers can become discouraged if they do not recieve any kind of response. For this reason, allowing users to like and interact with listings is beneficial for retaining sellers. It creates a more fulfilling experience, even if they do not end up selling the item. A major pain point of resale markets is establishing trustworthiness. Users are sometimes hesitant to buy items because they are unsure of the quality of the product and the trustworthiness of the seller. For this reason, the app will contain a user profile and review system, which will allow users to have greater assurance of the trustworthiness of other users. 

* **Persona & Three Features:** Based on the results of the heuristic evaluation and user research, I have designed two personas in order to better explore the goals, motivations, needs, and pain points of users. The first persona is a 21-year-old college student. As a college student with a limited budget, she needs a way to purchase furniture affordably, from a buyer she can trust. Moreover, she wants to save money on the cost of transporting furniture, so she wants to buy local furniture. Threfore, needs a way to filter listings by their location. Her biggest concern is the quality of the furniture. Since refunds are usually not available on resale markets, she is concerned with the condition of the furniture and the trustworthiness of the seller. The second persona is a 40-year-old working mother of two, who is looking to sell some of her family's used furniture. As a working parent who is not especially tech savvy, she needs a platform that provides an easy and quick listing process. Her biggest concern is convenience and ease of use.

* Based on the findings, I have identified several prime features that would address the needs and pain points of users:
  * **Filters** - Allow users to filter by type, color, condition, price, and location.
  * **Simple listing process that has pre-set categories and allows you to copy prior listings** - This makes listing easier and more convenient.
  * **User profiles and reviews** - This creates greater trustworthiness and less anonymity, which erodes trustworthiness.

* The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to begin the implementation of these features and assess the overall usability and functionality of my initial design of the app. Through this process I hope to gain greater insight into how the design can be improved and how these features can be implemented in order to create  seamless and pleasant user experience.

#### Testing Summary
The prototype testing procedure was conducted remotely over Zoom. Prior to the meeting, I sent the participant an image of all the wireframes, asking them not to view them prior to the meeting. During the testing, I asked the participant to complete 4 tasks:

   1. **Search for an item and filter the search results.**<br/>
   2. **View your offers and show how to accept or deny them.**<br/>
   3. **View the items that you favorited.**<br/>
   4. **View reviews of a seller.**

The participant was instructed to voice their thought process during the procedure. They were also instructed to circle the buttons that they'd press and make any notes if they woud like to. Several times throughout the testing, I asked the participant to describe what they expected to happen once they press a button. For the most part, the testing went smoothly, and I was able to gain important insight into how the product can be improved. The participant was able to complete all four tasks without too much issue. However, the participant's comments throughout the test helped me discover aspects that would benefit from additional revision:
* In the current design, the offers and messages are under separate tabs. Users need to switch between the two tabs, which makes the user process less smooth and more disjoint. It may be beneficial to put them under the same tab to improve the flow of communication between users. 
* On the profile, it may be beneficial to reconsider where to put the 5-stars that denote reviews. Currently, they are located under the 'Reviews' heading. The logic behind this was that I wanted to put the stars where the user is supposed to click to view the reviews. However, this slightly confuses the hierarchy of the design. It may be better to put the stars under the name. However, doing this might also be problematic, since users might click the stars expecting to view the reviews, when they are supposed to click the tabs instead. 
* Consider adding a cue for categories on the homepage? Currently, they are located on the searchpage. Users may not realize that they should click the search page to view categories.
* There is no cue for where the user should go to view offers. The participant wasn't sure whether to click the message icon or the user icon. Future iterations should add better signalling for this feature.
* Currently, on the homepage, users have to scroll right to view more items in the same category. This may be problematic because they may lose their place. Additionally, scrolling right feels much less natural than scrolling down. Therefore, it may be beneficial to replace it with a solelyl vertical-scrolling format.
* The filtering option caused some slight confusion, since there are filtering options on both the top and bottom of the page. Consider putting the filter button at the top of the page with the other options.
* Consider making the user page more visual. Currently, it looks like a settings menu, rather than a profile. This isn't what the participant expected when she clicked the icon.
* Include the option of adding photos to reviews. Also, consider adding a feature that allows users to view only the photos from reviews (ala Yelp).

## Reflection
Overall, the results from the prototype test were extremely informative. I learned a lot of information on how I can improve my product, as well as design aspects that I should consider revising. I also learned about the process of designing and testing a prototype, such as how to carry out the testing. While for the most part, the participant was able to smoothly complete all four of the tasks, they made many comments and voiced important thoughts on aspects of the app that may cause confusion and ambiguity, as well as aspects that could be revised in order to improve the usability and functionality of the app in order to ensure a smooth and easy user experience. 

In future iterations, I will revise aspects of the app such as the filter button placement, the message/offer system, the format of the homepage, and the format of the user page. Through testing, I was able to identify that these features are potentially problematic for usability, with room for improvement and revision. I had already suspected certain aspects might confuse users, such as the message/offering system and the filter button placement. The test procedure helped me confirm that these aspects need more redesigns. Other issues were less expected, such as the lack of cues for viewing categories of items and the problems with horizontal scrolling on the homepage. The test procedure helped me discover these issues so that I can reconsider and revise these aspects. In future prototype testing, I would like to implement a live prototype, which would feel more natural and more similar to the final product than non-clickable prototypes. I would also like to test wireframes of the listing procedure, which would be an important aspect of the app.
